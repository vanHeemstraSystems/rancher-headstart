# Rancher - Headstart

Based on "Up and Running : Rancher Weekly Class" at https://community.suse.com/courses/5804003/events/up-and-running-rancher-weekly-class/list

Modern cloud-native applications require high availability and distribution from their Kubernetes environments. As a result, a multi-cluster model is an increasingly optimal approach to achieve the kind of desired performance in these environments. However, this requires a proper system to create consistency in the areas of lifecycle management, security, visibility, organization and workload management across the downstream clusters. Rancher is a multi-cluster management platform that enables you to achieve Kubernetes cluster management in each of these dimensions and more.  

Over an eight-week period, this free course will equip you to understand the fundamentals of the Rancher architecture and Kubernetes multi-cluster management operations. At a high level, you will learn the installation and initial setup and configuration of Rancher. From there, you will be guided through how to execute various downstream cluster operations and application management in the clusters managed by Rancher.  

Your instructor [Lukonde Mwila](https://community.suse.com/members/6762788), Technical Evangelist in the SUSE & Rancher Community, will lead the conversation.
